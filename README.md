# MindStudio SPA Scaffold

This template provides a minimal setup to edit and build a custom interface in MindStudio.

The `.remy` directory exposes a simple, websocket-based control server for updating the code that is running, as well as auto-installing packages.

The `src` directory is a Vite TypeScript React app that contains the source of the interface. At this time, the MindStudio IDE only supports editing a single file (in this case, `src/App.tsx`).
